Kubernetes is quickly becoming the de-facto standard for running workloads on machines. It's been embraced by Fortune 500s as well as startups alike. There's a vibrant ecosystem around it, with many wonderful projects that are built on top of Kubernetes, solving [these](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler) [important](https://istio.io/) [problems](https://prometheus.io/).

However, the learning curve remains steep for developers. For many, using Kubernetes means spending weeks and months learning about various components, and copying YAML definitions from [Medium](https://medium.com) posts to make it all work. Even when it's set up, it remains a challenge to operate it: from things like rolling back a bad release, to keeping software versions up to date. These are outside of scope of Kubernetes itself, and yet are real problems when operating a cluster in production.

Given the plethora of components that are out there, you have to become proficient in each one to know when to use it, and how to make it work for your needs. As you can imagine, that's a non-trivial amount of knowledge that can become a nightmare to keep track of. In order to make it all manageable, companies with scale would devote internal teams on tooling around Kubernetes. However, those tools primary stay in-house, and every company has to reinvent the wheel.

The inspiration for Konstellation comes from having worked at two companies that have taken different paths to adopting Kubernetes. At Evie Labs, my previous startup, we went through the steep learning curve to get on Kubernetes. Yet due to a lack of tools, we used Kubernetes raw. It was painful for developers to use: having to hand map YAML resources was extremely error prone. At Medium, we've invested in an impressive set of internal solutions that made Kubernetes practical for developers, but those tools remain tightly coupled to our needs and codebase. Having gone through the same pain points twice, I wanted an open source solution that was robust and easy to use.

With that thought, I wrote the first line of code for Konstellation in November 2019. From the onset, my goal is to create a solution as simple to use as Heroku, while running on a robust layer that Kubernetes provides. Konstellation is designed to give you most (if not all) of tools necessary to deploy and operate apps on Kubernetes.
