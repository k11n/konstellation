## Requirements

Konstellation works with EKS today. Google GKE and Azure AKS are both on the roadmap in the future. I welcome contributions from the community if that's what you are looking for. Right now we are focused on AWS.

Before you start, ensure that you have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) installed.

Konstellation requires an S3 bucket to store state related to the cloud resources that you create. It doesn't rely on any other databases. App-specific configurations & attributes are stored in Kubernetes itself as resources.

## Installation

Konstellation CLI is be compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows. On Mac it's available via Brew. Otherwise you could build it from source.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="mac"
  values={[
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="mac">

```
% brew tap k11n/konstellation
% brew install konstellation
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```
% git clone https://github.com/k11n/konstellation.git
% cd konstellation
% make cli
% cp -Rv cmd/kon /usr/local/bin
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When this is installed, run `kon --version` to confirm the CLI is correctly installed

A single binary is all you need to use the CLI.


## Configuration

```bash
% kon setup
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a cloud provider to configure:
  ▸ AWS
```

Konstellation requires a few pieces information before creating a cluster:

* AWS Access Key and Secret Key - used to manage AWS resources
* An S3 bucket to store Konstellation state
* Region(s) that you intend to use

This setup needs to be performed only once.
