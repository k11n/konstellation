## Requirements

Konstellation works with EKS today. Google GKE and Azure AKS are both on the roadmap. We welcome contributions from the community if that's what you are looking for. Right now we are focused on AWS.

Before you start, ensure that you have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) installed.

Konstellation requires an S3 bucket to store state related to the cloud resources that you create. It doesn't rely on any other databases. App-specific configurations & attributes are stored in Kubernetes itself as resources.

## Installation

Konstellation CLI is be compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows. On Mac it's available via Brew. Otherwise you could build it from source.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="mac"
  values={[
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="mac">

```
% brew tap k11n/konstellation
% brew install konstellation
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```
% git clone https://github.com/k11n/konstellation.git
% cd konstellation
% make cli
% cp -Rv bin/kon /usr/local/bin
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When this is installed, run `kon --version` to confirm the CLI is correctly installed

A single binary is all you need to use the CLI.


## Configuration

```bash
% kon setup
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a cloud provider to configure:
  ▸ AWS
```

Konstellation requires a few pieces information before creating a cluster:

* AWS Access Key and Secret Key - used to manage AWS resources
* An S3 bucket to store Konstellation state
* Region(s) that you intend to use

This setup needs to be performed only once.
